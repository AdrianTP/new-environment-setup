- [ ] lines to copy or link .irbrc and .pryrc
- [ ] lines to copy or link utils/relink.sh
- [ ] general cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] finish utils/key-fingerprint
- [ ] figure out Brewfile situation
- [ ] decide:
  - [ ] maintain separate profile files for each environment?
  - [ ] assemble them in a buildfrom a series of sub-files?
    - [ ] setup.sh creates a build folder if not exist
    - [ ] build folder is in .gitignore
    - [ ] original profile and config files are renamed and built files are
          symlinked in their place
    - [ ] con: this approach would require re-building each time a change is made
  - [ ] `source <sub-file>` added to live `~/.bash_profile` for each sub-file
